Who We Are
theCoderSchool is the #1 after-school coding program in Silicon Valley. The future will be ever more dependent on technology so let's get our young generation ready. Learn to Code, Change the World. 

http://sanramon.thecoderschool.com

Job Summary
Code Coaching remotely via Zoom platform - Unity, Swift, Android a plus!
theCoderSchool San Ramon is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world! You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code (and how to think like a coder!), and be rewarded with an amazing experience. This is a part-time position for 2-20 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule. Our open hours will be generally 1:30 - 7:30 pm on select weekdays and Saturday and Sunday from 9 - 2. We will provide Instructor Training, and will use more of a ""teaching methodology"" than a curriculum. Much of our teaching will be reverse-engineering games or concepts, and will adapt to a particular student's interests and skills.

Responsibilities
A Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code. At theCoderSchool, we have three basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.
1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring. One-to-one or one-to-few coding lessons for kids. Typically in Scratch/Snap for the younger kids and Javascript/HTML, Python and beyond for older kids. Specialty programming like Unity or Swift helpful as well!
2. Code Class - Scratch and Python groups. Certain coaches that can manage a group of kids will be asked to inspire coders in group Code Class. This has a fixed-curriculum for drag-and-drop languages or Python that you'll teach in a classroom style.

This position rocks because you will:
* Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are ready to learn, and potentially manage a team of kids to create an application.
* Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in Silicon Valley.
* Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology

Requirements
What do we want from you? Read on.
* PASSION. All caps! You ooze excitement for technology; you can't wait to play with the latest 3D gaming platform. Your students must be inspired by your energy and enthusiasm :)
* Great Communicator. There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course it's often necessary to explain concepts in a few different ways!
* Kid at heart. Our best coaches understand what gets kids excited because they love the same things: gamers please apply!
* Coding Skills. Strong grasp of basic procedural programming. General knowledge of one or more languages is assumed - Scratch, Python, C++, Java, Javascript, PHP and HTML/CSS are most helpful.  Deep technical skills aren't necessarily required - we prefer you communicate and empathize well with your students. 
* Big bonus for game development and app development: Unity especially.  Swift or Android App experience is a plus!
* Experience teaching kids is a plus

Interested? Send us an email with a cover letter and resume. Let's do this! "

Market-driven, disruptive startup with experienced team is seeking a Senior Developer with front end or full-stack development abilities.

Our team is led by serial entrepreneurs including both a CEO and CTO with a history of multiple exits. In addition, our team consists of data scientists, finance specialists, digital marketing professionals, and an experienced CEO with a background in AI/machine learning and business development. The founders also spearheaded a public alpha test which, although intended solely to garner extrapolatable market data from a small test group, resulted in overwhelming, explosive growth and user adoption that we were not prepared for. In direct response to this unintentional early market traction, we are currently scaling up the team and development horsepower in order to expand the next version of our product in several strategic regions.

Our 2020 focus is on building out and releasing the scalable beta product in order to rapidly drive revenue into the high-six or low-seven digits within one year. The current team is receiving all compensation in company stock in order to preserve existing capital until the full product launch and achievement of stable revenue. Salaries will be provided once access to greater capital is available through revenue streams and/or the obtainment of additional funding. As such, compensation for this position is strictly company stock until access to greater capital is available.

Please note that we are not looking for an employee -- we are looking for a fellow team member who possesses the passion, motivation, and competency necessary to go forth with us as we scale and continue to build something truly disruptive.The current founding team possesses expertise in many critical fields, from finance to marketing to data science to business operations, and we are looking to add a Senior Developer with either front end or full-stack development capability that can bring their own unique expertise and passion to the team.

Next book is in early stages and we're aiming for the startup philosophy of ""You should be embarrassed by the first version you ship"".  Working title is ""100 days to a $200k+ job"".

Here's the preamble that we're posting publicly to recruit early readers:

My coauthor and I are both highly-paid employees at Big Tech companies.

That's today.  

Previously, we both failed multiple ""big tech"" interview processes then succeeded.

And now we're writing a simple book to teach people a systematic step-by-step process to succeed.

We both felt overwhelmed by the book Cracking the Coding Interview and the super-pricey ""Interview Cake"" course, and The Algorithm Design Manual... and even after buying these, didn't get through them – we said ""screw it"". After all, we're both passionate programmers, have worked at many startups, and have tons of industry experience (only one of us has a CS degree).

What we did was conquer the path into great jobs at great companies and we want to pave the way for others. As such, we are seeking ""beta readers"" to provide brutal feedback on an early draft of our book.  

This is a simple, easy-to-read book – it's a manual, and it's intended to be as readable as a GETTINGSTARTED.md guide of an easy-breezy open source project.  

This is NOT a bootcamp; this NOT an income-share agreement program.  

This is a book (currently, a manuscript in Google Docs format), and we need people to provide brutal feedback.

Here are our expectations:

0) Send me an DM with a quick blurb on your background.  You should have at least one year of industry experience as a programmer, but even better if you have 10+.  We'll reach out and schedule an intro call at your convenience.

1) You read through the entire draft and provide Comments in the Google Doc:

* When you get bored, stop reading, and check social media (HN/Twitter/Reddit/etc)
* When you roll your eyes
* When you want to share a quote or section with a friend
* When you laugh, get excited, or feel hooked
* Which sections you loved, and which ones you hated
* Anytime something is confusing or rubs you the wrong way

2) Phone call once you're done for a full debrief

3) In exchange, you get:

* Highly likely chance of increasing your income permanently
* Paperback copy of the book upon release
* Your name in the acknowledgments sections of the book
* $50 gift card (small token of gratitude, rather to illustrate that we have skin in the game)


Interested?  DM and proceed.    "
