# Cragslist-WebScraping

Web Scraping is the process of automating data extraction from websites. When the webpage structure is so complicated, making it difficult to extract specific pieces of data, or when you need to open so many pages to extract data from each of them, the manual process can become boring and time-wasting, and that is when automated Web Scraping can make the process more efficient and effective.

I have used BeautifulSoup & Requests to scrape & crawl Craigslist directory with Python. Saved the scraped output to a CSV/Excel file.

You need to install BeautifulSoup, Requests, pandas libraries using pip command inorder to run this project.
